# Graphite Docker image 

## Description

Graphite is an enterprise-scale monitoring tool that runs well on cheap
hardware.

Graphite does two things:

- Store numeric time-series data
- Render graphs of this data on demand

This Docker image includes the storage part of graphite and an the graphite-api
component. *It does not include the graphite-web component*, so you will need
another software to visualize the data you inject to graphite.

## How to run it
